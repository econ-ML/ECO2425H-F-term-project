    "# Orthogonal Random Forest and Causal Forest: Use Cases and Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal Forests and Generalized Random Forests are a flexible method for estimating treatment effect heterogeneity with Random Forests. Orthogonal Random Forest (ORF) combines orthogonalization, a technique that effectively removes the confounding effect in two-stage estimation, with generalized random forests. Due to the orthogonalization aspect of this method, the ORF performs especially well in the presence of high-dimensional confounders. For more details, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03467) or the [EconML docummentation](https://econml.azurewebsites.net/).\n",

    "\n",
    "* DROrthoForest: suitable for discrete treatments\n",
    "\n",
    "* CausalForest: suitable for both discrete and continuous treatments\n",
